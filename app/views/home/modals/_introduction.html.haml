        %p.lead Are you ready to make some boxes?! Let's go!
        %p
          Thanks for using
          %strong Makeabox.io! This site has been running since 2015, helping thousands of people generate
          PDF blueprints that can be used to laser-cut 3D enclosures.
        %h3 How does it work?
        %p
          You provide the
          %strong
            A) internal box dimensions
          of your enclosure (the size of the empty box inside),
          %strong
            B) thickness
          of the desired material, and then you simply click on the "Download PDF" button, and after working for a few seconds on the backend, we will send you the generated PDF document containing the template. You load up the template into Corel Draw, or Adobe Illustrator, tweak what you need, and then spool it to your laser cutter as per specifications of your laser cutter hardware.

          The downloaded file name will reflect some of the main dimensions you provided.
        %h3 What about these "teeth" I see on each side?
        %p
          Yes, indeed. You can see them in the picture below. They are called
          %strong
            teeth, tabs or notches,
          but they all mean the same thing. They help each side snap in place when assembled, making the overall design much sturdier and easier to put together.

        %p
          Makeabox automatically generates "snap-on tabs", and does it in a very specific way to ensure complete symmetry for each side of the enclosure. To achieve that requires dividing each side into an odd number of equidistant sections. Symmetric designs generated by this tool are distinguished by being super easy to assemble, as there should ever only be 3 variations.

        %p
