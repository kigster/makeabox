__This__ is the link:https://makeabox.io/[makeabox application] that generates laser-cut path as a downloadable PDF file.

INFO: It's recently been upgraded to use Rails 7.1 under the hood.

== Prerequisites

Assuming you develop on OS-X, it should be pretty trivial to get MakeABOX runnign locally using the provided Makefile:

[source,bash]
----
 make help

  brew          Installs Homebrew if on OS-X
  bundle        Run the local test suite
  deploy-quick  Deploy makeabox to production using Capistrano, skips tests and git status
  deploy        Deploy makeabox to production using Capistrano
  git-status    Ensures the local repo is clean
  help          Prints help message auto-generated from the comments.
  lint-fix-all  Runs rubocop with a more dangerous auto-correct
  lint-fix      Runs rubocop with auto-correct
  lint          Runs rubocop
  pre-commit    Runs rspec and rubocop before the commit
  ruby          Installs Ruby if needed
  test          Run the local test suite
----

=== Setup

If you don't have `make` in your system, you should run `xcode-select --install` to install the XCode command line tools, which will install `make` for you, as well as `git`.

After that, you can try running:

[source,bash]
----
make test
----

Running RSpecs via the Makefile depends on having `bundle install` ran, which in turn depends on having Ruby installed.

Ruby is installed via `rbenv`, which is installed via `brew` on OS-X, and via `apt` on Linux.

Finally, `make pre-commit` will run both specs and rubocop to ensure your changes are green on CI.

== Run the App Locally

To run the app locally, run it via `make`:

[source,bash]
----
make puma
----

This should start Puma, and open a browser window to https://localhost:3000/ where you can see the app running.

You can also start puma via:

[source, bash]
----
❯ bin/puma-start
----

== Deploying

=== Prerequisites

Before the next step, you need to have the private SSH key that Amazon gave you for your account, so that you can login as the user `ubuntu` and essentially — `root`.

Place this PEM file into a specific location: `${HOME}/.ssh/makeabox.pem` and everything else will be easy.

=== Automatic Deploy

Deploy is provided with Capistrano.

[source,bash]
----
make deploy
----

OR, if you have locally modified changes you don't want to check in yet, then:

[source,bash]
----
make deploy-quick
----

=== Manual Deploy

You can, of course, drive Capistrano by hand:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec cap production deploy --trace
----
