__This__ is the https://makeabox.io/ application that generates laser-cut path as a downloadable PDF file.

NOTE: It's recently been upgraded to use Rails 6.1 under the hood.

== USAGE

NOTE: `direnv` is recommended.

[source, bash]
----
brew install direnv
# If using BASH:
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
direnv allow .
----

== Install Dependencies

Use Ruby 3.0.2 and a recent bundler:

[source, bash]
----
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
----

== Run Locally

You can start Puma via `rails s`, but we prefer using a wrapper script:

[source, bash]
----
❯ bin/puma-start
[71761] Puma starting in cluster mode...
...
[71761] * Process workers: 6
[71761] * Phased restart available
[71761] * Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000
[71761] Use Ctrl-C to stop
----

If the Puma process does not respond to `Ctrl-C`, use `Ctrl-Z` to push it to the background, and then `kill -9 %1` where `%1` is the job ID given during the suspend event.

[source, bash]
----
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 bin/puma-start
❯ kill -9 %1
----

The job number appears in the square brackets next to "Stopped". If the number is greater than one, it means you have other background jobs running. Run `jobs -l` to see them.

== Deploying

=== Prerequisites

Before the next step, you need to have the private SSH key that Amazon gave you for your account, so that you can login as the user `ubuntu` and essentially — `root`.

Place this PEM file into a specific location: `${HOME}/.ssh/makeabox.pem` and everything else will be easy.

=== Automatic Deploy

Use the provided shell script:

[source,bash]
----
bin/deploy
----

=== Manual Deploy

You can also deploy menually like so:

[source,bash]
----
ssh-add ${HOME}/.ssh/makeabox.pem
bundle exec cap production deploy --trace
----

== Previewing in Production Mode

This script shows you the site in a local but production mode:

[source,bash]
----
direnv allow . # just once
preview
# or
bin/preview
----
